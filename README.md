## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
Overview

We propose a Smart Crop Advisory System, delivered via a mobile app and chatbot interface, that provides personalized, AI-driven agricultural guidance. It leverages real-time data on weather, soil, crop history, and pest patterns to generate recommendations tailored to individual farmers' needs.

How It Addresses the Problem

Localized Advisory: Recommendations based on geolocation, crop history, and soil data.

AI Diagnostics: Computer vision model to detect pests and diseases through image analysis.

Language Inclusivity: App and chatbot available in major Indian languages with text and voice support.

Decision Support: Weather forecasts, fertilizer schedules, and crop planning tools.

Market Integration: Live updates on nearby mandi prices to guide sales.

User-Centric Design: Simple, intuitive interface for low-literacy users.

Innovation and Uniqueness

Integration of AI/ML for real-time advisory, including image-based pest detection.

Multilingual voice chatbot designed specifically for low-literacy rural users.

Predictive analytics to inform crop selection and input optimization.

Feedback-driven design that learns and improves with usage patterns.
## Technical Approach
Technologies Used

Frontend: Flutter (for cross-platform mobile development)

Backend: Node.js / Python (Flask/FastAPI)

Database: PostgreSQL, Firebase Realtime DB (for sync)

AI/ML: TensorFlow / PyTorch (for pest detection, advisory engine)

NLP: Indic NLP Library, Google Text-to-Speech / Whisper ASR for voice interaction

APIs:

IMD for weather data

Government soil health and crop datasets

Agmarknet for market prices

Implementation Flow

User Registration

Language preference, location (auto-detected/GPS), crop type

Dashboard

Crop advisory, soil tips, weather alerts

Image Upload

For pest/disease identification

## Feasibility and Viability
Feasibility Analysis

High smartphone penetration in rural India (growing steadily).

Government initiatives promoting digital agriculture.

Availability of open datasets (IMD, Agmarknet, soil health cards).

Proven effectiveness of ICT-based advisories.

Potential Challenges

Limited internet access in remote areas.

Trust and adoption barriers among older farmers.

Language diversity and dialectal differences.

Mitigation Strategies

Offline mode with periodic sync.

Partnerships with Krishi Vigyan Kendras (KVKs), NGOs for on-ground training.

Voice-first interface with dialect customization.
